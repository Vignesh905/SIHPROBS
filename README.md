## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

Ministry of Environment

## Idea

To tackle the growing challenge of e-waste management, we propose the development of an integrated digital platform that facilitates the proper disposal and recycling of electronic devices. This platform will not only provide users with information on nearby e-waste collection and recycling facilities but also educate them on the environmental and health impacts of improper disposal. Additionally, it will incentivize responsible disposal through a credit points system based on the recovery of precious metals from disposed devices.
